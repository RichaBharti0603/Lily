<b>💡Problem Statement</b><br>
Victims of domestic violence often can't call for help openly due to fear, surveillance, or proximity to their abuser. There is a need for a discreet, secure, and fast way to alert authorities or trusted contacts silently.

<b>🎯 Objective</b><br>
To develop a mobile application that enables users to send silent alerts (via tap pattern, voice command, or background button) to pre-configured emergency contacts or authorities without drawing attention.

<b>🛠️ Core Features</b><br>

<b>Feature	Description</b> <br>
🔕 Silent SOS Trigger	Triple-tap on the phone screen, shake device, or whisper a code word to send an alert.<br>
📍 Location Tracking	Sends current GPS location to emergency contacts.
🗣️ Secret Voice Command	User whispers a configured safe word (e.g., "I'm okay") that triggers an alert.
🧍‍♀️ Fake Interface	App looks like a harmless utility (e.g., calculator), but turns into emergency mode on input.
📸 Auto Media Capture (Optional)	Captures 3-second video/audio & sends with alert.
🔐 Data Encryption	Ensures that personal info & alert data is securely stored and transmitted.
💌 Emergency Contact Setup	User adds trusted contacts who receive alerts.
🛑 Cancel Alert Button	A hidden pattern/word to cancel accidental alerts.
📖 Awareness & Resources	Includes legal help, helpline numbers, support groups, blogs.
